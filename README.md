# Stock Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables

This repository contains a dataset of stock market information, designed for practicing pivot table skills in Excel or other spreadsheet tools. The project focuses on analyzing key metrics for companies across various sectors, using raw data and answering specific business questions.

**This exercise is inspired by the Analyst Builder course by Alex Freberg. Full credit to Alex Freberg for creating this engaging and educational exercise.**

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`Raw_Data/`**: Contains the original dataset for analysis.
- **`Final_Analysis/`**: Contains the final pivot tables and answers to the analysis questions.

## üìä Analysis Objectives

1. **What is the Average Dividend Yield?**
   - Per **Sector** and **Company**.
   
2. **What is the Total Market Cap per Sector?**
   - Market Cap is calculated as `Price * Shares`.

3. **Which sectors meet the investment criteria?**
   - Criteria:
     - Dividend Yield > 2
     - Market Cap > Sector's average
